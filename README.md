# Data Sci: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used in this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

# CodeBook.md 
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
# run_analysis.R
It does the following steps
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# tidydata.txt
It is the independent tidy data set obtained from the step 5 that summarises the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. It is exported in the text format.
